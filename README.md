Thoughtjar stores data in localStorage and uses service workers to allow offline use. It's probably closer to a pretty todo list than anything else, but I've found that I use it a lot!

It's fine as-is for my own personal use, but in the future I'd like to implement authentication and a database to have the app sync across devices, and maybe multiple lists.
